All about Blockchain at CSUF.

<!-- more -->

# Welcome!

This is the beginning of Blockchain at CSUF. We are a growing community of blockchain enthusiasts. 

# Another club?? Why should I join this one?

The problem with computer science focused clubs at CSUF is that people join, and then never interact. This happens by forced interactions, excessive club advertisment, and 0 engagement. With Blockchain at CSUF, we strictly grow by word of mouth, and membership roles in the club discord are obtained by active participation. If you don't participate, you are automatically removed from the discord.

This ensures a fresh, active community that has an investment in learning, partcipating in discussions, and building things related to blockchain.

# Do I have to be a computer science student to join?

Nope! The amazing thing about blockchain is that it intersects a lot of great disciplines. Some of the top blockchain companies hire scientists, ecologists, economists, and more.
